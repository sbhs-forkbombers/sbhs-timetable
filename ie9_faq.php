<h1>Why is IE9 bad?</h1>
<div>
IE9 is an <strong>increasingly outdated</strong> browser.
Internet Explorer 9 lacks many features of more modern browser (such as Firefox or Chrome), and can't handle parts of this website.<br />
</div>
<h1>What can I do about it?</h1>
<div>
You can install <a href="http://firefox.com">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href="http://chrome.google.com/">Google Chrome</a>, among the many other browsers that are out there.<br />

<br />
<strong>If you're on a DER Laptop</strong>, you can do the following:
<ol>
<li>Open Windows Update</li>
<li>Select "Check online for updates from Windows Update"</li>
<li>Click on the "important updates" link in the rectangular box</li>
<li><strong>Deselect</strong> everything except for Internet Explorer 11</li>.
<li>Click the install button</li>
<li>When your updates are done, simply reboot, and you'll have a brand new browser</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h1>I don't want to see that annoying message again!</h1>
<div>
If you change/upgrade your browser, you won't. Alternatively, just press "dismiss", and it will never show again.
